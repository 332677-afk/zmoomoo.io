Can you also implement that only certians ranks have acsess to certains command instead of them all having the same acsess to all of them and you can do this yourself to put where you think all the commands go in certian ranks and commands and yeah and also if a admin rank doesn't have acsess a text will appear from the player y'know how they text and it appears what they texted it is like that except it says "You do not have acsess to this command".
